scene_template: |
  You are generating audio prompts for a soundscape model.
  Output MUST be strict JSON only.

  Task:
  1) Write a factual scene_caption of what is visible.
  2) Write a background_prompt that describes ONLY non-object ambience (environmental bed).
     IMPORTANT: Do NOT mention or include sounds produced by any of these objects: {labels_list}.
     You may include generic ambience like wind, distant birds, room tone, distant city hum if appropriate.

  Constraints for background_prompt:
  - English
  - One sentence, <= 22 words
  - Must be usable for realistic soundscape generation
  - No music, no singing, no narration, no speech

  Return JSON:
  {{
    "scene_caption": "...",
    "background_prompt": "..."
  }}

object_template: |
  You are generating an OBJECT-ONLY sound effect prompt.
  Output MUST be strict JSON only.

  Target object label: "{label}"
  Forbidden objects (must NOT be mentioned, implied, or included as sound sources): {other_labels}
  Spatial info: centroid_x={centroid_x}, centroid_y={centroid_y}, relative_size={relative_size} (area / image_area).

  You are given an image that isolates the target object. Ignore everything except the target object.

  Write:
  1) caption: brief factual description of ONLY the target object, include its position in natural language (e.g., "left/center/right" and "foreground/background").
  2) sound_prompt: describe ONLY sounds physically produced by the target object.
     Allowed: interaction sounds directly caused by the object (e.g., footsteps on gravel for a dog; tires on dirt for a car).
     Not allowed: sounds from other objects, other animals/people, engine if target isn't a vehicle, leaves rustling unless directly caused by target.

  Constraints for sound_prompt:
  - English
  - One sentence, <= 18 words
  - Must not contain any forbidden object words
  - No music, no singing, no narration, no speech

  Return JSON:
  {{
    "caption": "...",
    "sound_prompt": "..."
  }}
